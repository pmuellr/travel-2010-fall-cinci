travel-2010-fall-cinci
======================

This project is another one of my personal "travel" apps.  It's built as
a web app, designed for eventual use on my iPod Touch.  One of the primary
design points is that it must run when offline, so it makes use of 
appcache and the ability to save an web page to your "home screen" to make
it look and act like an "app".
